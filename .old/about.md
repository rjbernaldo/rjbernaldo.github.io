**I am Rj Bernaldo**, a Software Engineer currently based in Manila, Philippines.

Apart from my gig as a Ruby on Rails & Angular.js developer at [PromisePay](https://promisepay.com/), I am constantly searching for areas to grow. That's why I express my creativity through personal side projects like:

- [BigBertha](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/big-bertha), a Messenger bot for finding the best restaurant deals within your vicinity
- [Tutorialify](https://github.com/rjbernaldo/tutorialify), an open source project to turn any Github repo's commits into a chronological step by step tutorial built using React.js
- [Feature Request Prototype](https://github.com/rjbernaldo/feature-request-prototype), an experiment to try TDD using React.js and Jest
- [React Pong](https://github.com/rjbernaldo/react-pong/), the classic Pong game built using ES6 syntax, React.js, and HTML5 canvas
