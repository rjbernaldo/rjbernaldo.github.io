I am Rj Bernaldo, a Software Engineer currently based in Manila, Philippines. I went through [DevBootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) a couple of years ago back at San Francisco and have been searching for the perfect company to contribute to and the best team to grow my skills with since. Here are some relevant links:

- [Github](https://github.com/rjbernaldo)
- [LinkedIn](https://ph.linkedin.com/in/rjbernaldo)
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rjwhatn0w)

Apart from my current gig as a Ruby on Rails/Angular.js developer at [PromisePay](https://promisepay.com/), I am constantly searching for areas to grow. That's why I express my creativity through personal side projects like:

- [BigBertha](http://bigbertha.co), a product (Android/iOS hybrid app) to discover discounted meals from restaurants around the user built using Cordova, Ionic, and Angular.js.
- [Tutorialify](https://github.com/rjbernaldo/tutorialify), an open source project to turn any Github repo's commits into a chronological step by step tutorial built using React.js
- [Feature Request Prototype](https://github.com/rjbernaldo/feature-request-prototype), an experiment to try TDD using React.js and Jest
- [React Pong](https://github.com/rjbernaldo/react-pong/), the classic Pong game built using ES6 syntax, React.js, and HTML5 canvas
