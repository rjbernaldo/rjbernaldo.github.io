It was around 8 months ago when I decided I was going to resign from my last company. It was a startup based in Australia which developed Zendesk apps based on features that their user base wanted. This was a purely remote position, so I was the only developer working from Manila, everyone else was in Melbourne. My main point of contact (and source of work to do) was the lead developer.

Initially this was okay. I was learning a lot, developing on a pure JS stack, working with an experienced team lead. I was having TONS of fun. But a few months in, I noticed there was tension whenever we would do our daily standup. No one really talked to me about it. Then an announcement came that the team lead was leaving. At first I saw this as an opportunity to own more stuff, but one by one the developers started to leave until there was only two of us. It became immediately apparent that it would be impossible for me to tackle everything that came in.

This was when I decided that my main objective right now is to learn and this company is just not in the proper state to offer that kind of value, so I sent my resignation email. My plan was to initially survive for a few months (basically, be unemployed) and purely work on open source and side projects so I can focus on actual learning and forget about business, money, and deadlines.

Before I could even get started, I got a call from a startup that has a fantastic vision to change the landscape of Agriculture forever. I talked to the founders, I liked what I heard, and immediately joined with the thinking that "This is my chance to work on a project I really really care about." Unfortunately, what they did not told me was they got rid of the lead developer who worked on 99% of their current product, there was no official hand off, things were very sour with the development team, AND the release date was fixed which gave us 4 months to make the product work. Damn.

To be continued...
