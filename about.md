I am a Software Engineer based in Manila, Philippines. I went through DevBootcamp a couple of years ago back at San Francisco and have been searching for the perfect company to contribute to and the best team to grow my skills with.

Apart from my gig as a Python/Angular.js developer, I am constantly searching for areas to grow, and that is why I build apps in my free time using Cordova and Angular.js, the latest one I've built is Big Bertha (bigbertha.co)
